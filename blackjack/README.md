**********************************************

Notes:

* This project was created without following any tutorials. It is the first project I have attempted to create on my own, and it is currently a functional work in progress.

* Add a feature with setTimeout or something to delay the time it takes for each card to appear as they are "dealt", creating a game that's easier to follow from start to finish. This could have user input for adjustable deal speed.

* Add a split feature which allows the player to split the cards if dealt doubles.
